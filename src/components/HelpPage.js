    <p> Greetings traveler! Welcome to my small corner of the Galactic Mainframe.</p>
    <p>
    The last 100 years of human history have been among the most exciting of all time. With the
    development of FTL travel, we have expanded into the farthest reaches of space and witnessed
    things the likes of which our ancestors could never have imagined. But unfortunately, there is much that still eludes our comprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
    Which is where you, dear traveler, come in.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you've recieved access to this site, it means you're registered in the UN Interstellar Logs
    as a trader, scout, mercenary, or other space adventurer. Doubtless, you have traveled across the galaxy
    and seen things of which I, a humble researcher on Mars, could never dream.
    </p>
    <p>
    And this is your chance to tell the rest of the galaxy about them. This site is meant to serve
    as a repository for what I'm calling "Anomalies," irregular or unusual locations or events in the
    galaxy, things that we don't quite have the science down for.
    </p>
    <p>
    Strange quasars, unexplainable orbits, the derelect wreckage of a million year old space battle...
    </p>
    <p>
    But I don't want to get ahead of myself! Read some of the entries submitted by your fellow explorers
    if you're wondering what sorts of tales we're looking for. When you're ready, submit your own anomalies for
    review. If it passes muster it will be added to the database, where anyone in the galaxy can read it for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can also save your favorite anomalies to read later. If this little project of mine gains interest, I
    would like to add additional features, including the ability to log where in the galaxy your anomaly is located,
    and the ability to collaborate on more complicated descriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
    Until then, however, please enjoy! Browse some anomalies and add your own, and together we can add a bit more knowledge
    to this vast and unknowable universe.
    </p>
    <p>
    Sincerely,
    </p>
    <p>
